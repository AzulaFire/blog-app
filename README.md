## Getting Started

NextJS Client - 'use client'

useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext - all client side hooks. Any page event, like onClick, onChange need to happen on the client side. To have a component that is a server component but needs page events, make seperate components and set them to 'use client', then import them into the server components. For example, a button component with a onClick event.

NextJS components are Server Components by default.

NextJS Server components - GET - fetch()
Server Actions - POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
Route Handlers - (API) - Web Hooks
